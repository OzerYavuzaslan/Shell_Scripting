## Bash Scripts That Send Agents Info of Call Centers Via FTP from Linux to Windows OS:
---When there is at least one file in the specified folder my scripts are activated automatically by a program that checks the specified folder and starts sending the agents info files.
---If a problem occurs and at least one of these files can't be sent, not submitted files are moved to another folder then scripts try to send these not submitted files in time till they are sent.
